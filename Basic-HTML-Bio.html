<h2>My Life Story</h2>
  <p>
    Now, this is a story all about how
    My life got flipped-turned upside down
    And I'd like to take a minute
    Just sit right there
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
  </p>
  
  <p>  
    In west Philadelphia born and raised
    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
    And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
    She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <ul>  
    <li>I begged and pleaded with her day after day</li>
    <li>But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way</li>
    <li>She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.</li>
    <li>  I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.</li>
    <li>First class, yo this is bad</li>
    <li>Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.</li>
    <li> Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?</li>
    <li> Hmm this might be alright.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
    But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
    Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
    I don't think so
    I'll see when I get there
    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Well, the plane landed and when I came out
    There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
    I ain't trying to get arrested yet
    I just got here
    I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
    The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
    But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'
  </p> 
  
  <p>
    I pulled up to the house about seven or eigth
    And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later'
    I looked at my kingdom
    I was finally there
    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air
